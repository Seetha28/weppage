<P>Medicine courses are offered in various specialisations including Medical and Biomedical Sciences, Pharmacy, Allied Health, Nursing, Health, and Fitness. A course in Medicine and Health Sciences requires students to learn and abide by the Hippocratic Oath for ethical conduct which says, that as a medical practitioner a person needs to practice arts and science of medicine honestly in all aspects i.e. patient care, teaching and research. Students holding a degree in Medical and Health science will get career opportunities in hospitals, and private clinics in the healthcare sector. A Medical and Health Science graduate can also work with research centres, laboratories, and Pharmaceuticals Industry.

<H4> TECHNOLOGY </H4>
<p>Engineering technology is a major ingredient in the economic development of America and the world at large. Yet it’s a discipline that few people actually know about, or really understand.
<br><br>
This observation is one of the core findings of a 2017 report – Engineering Technology Education – presented to members of the House Manufacturing Caucus and the Senate Competitiveness Caucus, in Washington, DC. The report, published by the National Academy of Engineering, shows that while workers in the field of engineering technology (ET) play an important role in supporting U.S. technical infrastructure and the country’s capacity for innovation, there remains little awareness of ET as a field of study or category of employment.
